Backend QA
Using JavaScript and your favourite testing framework, create a suite of tests using the API available
from https://www.metaweather.com/api/ to:
1. Search for San Francisco
2. Verify the returned lat/long values for San Francisco match the city
3. Use San Francisco woeid to get details and print out the current weather state, wind speed
and current temperature
4. Use Bucharest woeid to get details and print out the weather state, wind speed and
temperature for the date of 17-05-2017 at 14:23
5. Optionally, when writing code to satisfy points 1-4, write in obvious extra checks for each of
the 3 APIs youâ€™re using for this exercise.


You can host the resulting project on github and send us the link or send the archived project via

Remember to also add instructions on how we can set up and run the project.
